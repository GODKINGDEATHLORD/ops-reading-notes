Self-Awareness:21
Self-Management:24
Social Awareness: 15
Relationship Management: 20

I dont think I can really grade myself accurately, even though its a self assessment because of inherient biases and the lack of social interactions, since ive gotten out of the Marine Corps. I know I scored low in Social Awareness, but I never assume what people are thinking. Ive seen people smile while happily commiting horrors so I keep an idea, but I dont hold too much weight on my own assumptions. I do keep calm in social enviorments while under pressure

[biases. ](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/career_coaching/301/bias-assessment.html)

For the Assesment I got an 85/120, my strongest areas being What is Bias, and Meaningful Connections. Im a black man who was homeless throughout highschool while attending school in a more privilidged part of orange county after going through hell in my adolescence. I had plenty of people growing up, telling me I had the same opportunities as a kid who drove a porshe to schools, and whos networth was more then my families life-savings, while my mom was taking money from checks while I was working 4 jobs to sustain myself in an area with such a high cost of living. I also appreciate recieving negative opinions if they are constructive in a shape, form ,or fashion.  My lowest areas were Bias & Identity, and Four Ways to Act. Sometimes I dont get along with people on my team, even in the Marine Corps, and in those enviorments everything was too fast- paced to try to hash things out sometimes, I dont talk about diversity in the workplace ( race, religion, gender) because I choose to ignore that I have an identifier sometimes. Ive been black my whole life, I forget im black, I forget people are asian, or white, or females, or whatever they choose, I just know theres people that I have to work with. Also I dont let my past define me, but there are some days where the scars of past show face, and theres nothing you can do but deal.
