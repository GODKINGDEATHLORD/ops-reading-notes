### 1.*What is an ISO File?*

It is a representation of the entirety of a CD, DVD, or BD 


### 2.*How do you write an ISO file to a CD, DVD, or removable media (like a thumb drive)?*

You would burn it to a CD/DVD/ or BD , and the process would be similar for a USB as well


### 3.*How do you create an ISO file?*

*I actually would have to write ISO files from disk every single day when I worked with F-35, and its just like making a file from a USB, but just a few extra steps. Maybe a bit more time too. I might butcher this because im going off of memory* 

1. Utilize a CDROM, or a disk reading and begin to run your disk
2.  Head into your file ecplorer and click on your file once it pops up in ayour library.
3.  there should be a green icon that will pop up in the right hand corner once you click on the temporary file, selec that and hit extract
4.  the computer will take some time fully extract the file and this is when you would enter your file name and change the file type to .iso

   I definetly butchered this, I just want to compare when we actually do the lab if we do , do one

### 4.*How do you mount an ISO file?*

Once you have your disk running you would go into the disc image tools and right click the file and hit mount
