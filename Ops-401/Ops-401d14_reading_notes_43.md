# [What is Sniffing Attack in System Hacking?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-sniffing-attack-in-system-hacking/)

1. Explain a Sniffing attack using non-technical terms.

    A sniffing attack is like eavesdropping on digital conversations. Imagine someone secretly listening to your private discussions and even meddling with the messages without you knowing.

2. What are the two types of sniffing attacks and what are some pros and cons of each approach?

    Passive Sniffing: Simply involves listening in without altering the traffic. It's less detectable but limited to what is being transmitted openly.

    Active Sniffing: Involves tampering with the communication, like impersonating one of the participants. It can be more powerful but is also more detectable and can be illegal.

3. How does encryption protect traffic against sniffing attacks?

    Encryption scrambles the data in the traffic, making it unreadable. If a sniffer intercepts encrypted data, it would just look like gibberish unless they have the key to decrypt it.
