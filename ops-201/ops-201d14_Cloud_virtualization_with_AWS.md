1. **How has virtualization evolved beyond desktops and servers?**

  "The same model eventually extended from desktops and servers to also cover the network, storage, data devices, as well applications (through app virtualization â€“ software encapsulation from the underlying operating system)."

2. **In the context of the Amazon IaaS Cloud Service Model, what does EC2 stand for?**

  EC2 stands for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. "An IaaS service that provides virtual servers based on the Xen hypervisor."

3. **What types of storage does EC2 use, and how is EC2 web traffic managed?**

  EC2 uses both Ephemeral and Elastic Block Storage, with snapshots stored in Amazon S3. "EC2 web traffic is load balanced as well as how it passes through various security rules."

4. **What are the benefits of service-oriented architecture for customers of EC2 virtualized services?**

The benefits include "the ability to control virtualization through a web interface, as well as to manage the entire system through API."

5. **Analyze how cloud virtualization can promote equitable access to technology resources across diverse populations. How can this technology bridge cultural gaps and empower underserved communities?**

 By enabling access to computing power and services through the internet, cloud virtualization can promote digital equity across geographic and socioeconomic divides. Underserved populations gain the ability to leverage critical tools for learning, entrepreneurship, and communication, despite potential barriers like location or income. Cloud technology's remote nature helps bridge deep-rooted inequities, bringing vital technological resources to communities that have historically lacked sufficient access.
