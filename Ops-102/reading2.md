# Reading Class 02: Build a Computer
## Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need?
Its a case by case basis to say which one is better, , more cores is better for more complicated task like video editing, and digital artwork as they allow multiple threads to run simealtaneosly. On the other hand, higher speeds is benefecial for task that rely on single-thread performnmance like using some office applications, or gaming. Yes gaming is a single-threaded function, Microsofts bing's search ai sent me down that rabbit hole. Despite the heavy emphasis in graphic qualities in todays game, and the fast p[ace gameplay, most games only use 3 cores at most while running with the exception of bigger multiplayer games like Battlefield. How many cores does the average user need? According ato the article provided the answer is ttypically 6. 
## What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?
First you want to know look for a motherboard that will physically fit your processor, so you must search for one that will fit the socket size of your cpu. Other things to keep in mind is wwireless/bluetooth capabilities, and extra slots for things like ram, ssd, nvme, and gpus in case you want expand or make adjustmenets to your pc in the future

## What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?
It really boils down to price, and performance. HDDS are typically slower than ssds but are slightly cheaper. HDDS usuallay run fdaround 40- 60 dollars according to bing AI , whereas an SSD is about 80. In my opinion you should just get the ssd. 
## Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?
1. MOTHERBOARD= command
2. CASE= Marine Corps
3. CPU= TOP 3 or leadership
4. RAM= Deparatments such as airframes, avionics, ordnance, seat shop, etc( excluding supply)
5. POWER SUPPLY= Supply
6. HDD or SDD= Administration & IPAC
7. COOLING SYSTEM= Marine Corps Orders, standard works, and Standard Operating Procedures
