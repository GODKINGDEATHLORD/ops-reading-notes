# Reading Class 01: China's Spy Chip
## How is a hardware hack different from a software hack?
(I have already typed a lot of notes originally as I read, but I'm going to provide a more abbreviated analysis. It's based more or less on memory, so there may be inconsistencies from the source document, but it will be mostly accurate. Also, my grammar may be off; in the future, I'll be more diligent.)

A hardware hack is something physical that affects a device and leaves a physical trail, whereas software infiltrates through the software.

## What are the two ways for spies to alter a computerâ€™s hardware?
The easiest way to hack a device is before it's distributed during the motherboard's creation. Hackers will mainly use interdiction and seeding. Interdiction involves manipulating devices as they're in transit from the manufacturer to the customer, while seeding involves making changes from the beginning.

## Explain how the hack worked?
China has control of about 97% of all technology that funnels through to America. In 2015, the company Elemental, which sells servers to high-profile corporations such as Amazon, Apple, the DoD, FBI, CIA, etc., subcontracted to a company called Supermicro to make its motherboards. These motherboards had a small chip with a small amount of data that was placed right before the CPU. This had two actions: it would make the computer send out all its data to several more powerful computers that would install malicious data, and it would prepare the computer to receive the code.

## How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source?
US intelligence was alerted to this threat prior to the breach but withheld the information from the public to save shares of Elemental, which is one of the US's biggest companies. Apple discovered it first after finding bugs in the phone, and after Amazon acquired Elemental, they conducted their own investigation and found even smaller microchips, some even embedded in the fiberglass of the motherboards. Because hardware hacks leave a paper trail, it was easy to trace it back to China, and it was traced back to about four different warehouses. Each was tampered with by the People's Liberation Army, which was known but unannounced by the CIA until the breach.

## Things I want to know more about
1. How can I set my PC to automatically save changes or perform autosaves in case my computer crashes or experiences issues? Apologies for my grammar; I'll accept the lower grade due to insufficient effort. Tonight has been very frustrating. The assignment was easy, but the power outage was making things unnecessarily difficult, and my Mac laptop was dead.

2. Can I see an example of a really good assignment?
