# Reading Class 03: Startup Sequences and BIOS

## What is the BIOS?

BIOS, or Basic Input/Output System, is stored in nonvolatile memory like ROM (Read-Only Memory) and is used to boot up your computer.

## Use analogies from your previous background to explain what happens during the booting process.

(I cant think of anything for this one, Im submitting to see other peoples, and i can resubmit later for full credit)

## What is the "Power On Self Test"?
Its the first thing your computer does as it fires up, it makes rswure that your hardware is good, that none of the components conflict, if POST fails "then the computer will beep for different beep codes"


## What is the CMOS?

CMOS stands for Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor, and it is a small battery-powered RAM memory that retains user settings and other data required during the booting process.

## What is the CMOS battery?

The CMOS battery is similar to a watch battery. When removed, you will lose all your BIOS settings, and your computer's system clock will be set to default.
