# [Readings](https://www.jscape.com/blog/implementing-the-cia-triad-when-transferring-files-through-the-internet): [Data file encryption](https://www.howtogeek.com/67241/htg-explains-what-are-md5-sha-1-hashes-and-how-do-i-check-them/)
## 1. You have been made responsible for the companyâ€™s file server. How would you preserve the three elements of the CIA triad? 

Use encryption to protect data, employ digital signatures, and ensure that that theres high availability ensuring im maintaining confidentialitaty, integrity, and availability


## 2. Explain how hashing verifies data integrity using non-technical terms.

hashing is like a complex random serial number, under a part number( hash type) if even a smidgen of information changes the serno scrambles completly. It is useful for verifying integrity cause when verifying the serial number because the differences would be outstanding 

## 3. How is hashing and encryption different? 

encryption is meant to encode data so only the desired recipeints can read it while , hashing is maeant more for verifying data integrity
