# Class 38: Burp Suite and Web Application Traffic Analysis

## How Burp Suite Allows Us to Analyze Web Application Traffic

Using the Burp Suite allows us to see how a website reacts to unusual requests.

## What the Repeater Tool Allows Us to Do with Requests

It allows you to import a web request, make manual modifications, and see it side by side, allowing you to make small adjustments to attempted exploits and see if it's working.

## Why This Might Be a Useful Tool for an Attacker

This may be a useful tool for an attacker because they can edit and redirect you to a webpage that is unsafe or make you see misleading information displayed on an otherwise trustworthy website.
