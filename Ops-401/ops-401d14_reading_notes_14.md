# [The Pros and Cons of Network Intrusion Detection Systems](https://blog.rapid7.com/2017/01/11/the-pros-cons-of-intrusion-detection-systems/)

1. List 2 differences between firewalls and an IDS?

    Firewalls limit access between networks based on access control policies, while IDS monitors and analyzes network traffic to detect suspicious activity.

2. Under what circumstances would you choose a network-based IDS over a host-based IDS?

    IDS provides a deeper network traffic inspection than firewalls.

    You'd choose a network-based IDS over a host-based IDS when you need to monitor a large and complex network.

3. Name 3 major drawbacks of a NIDS?
    - It can generate false positives and false negatives.
    - Network traffic encryption can limit its effectiveness.
    - High resource and maintenance requirements.
