# Reading Class 05: Installing Virtualbox with Linux Terminal
## Explain the terms “shell”, “terminal”, “cli”, and “command prompt”. Why are these still used today, when we have graphical interfaces?
1. shell- shell or sh is simply a interface that allows you to interact an interface by inputting a command, and in turn you'll recieve an output or result. There is no use of mouse in this interface, you can only use your keyboard according to the article
2. cli- according to bing , CLI stands for COmmand-line interface, and it is a version of shell ( uses alphanumeric characters typed on a keyboard to provide instructionsm and data to the operating system, interactively( which im confused because it still seems to be the same as shell but I guess I will learn tomorrow)
3. command prompt- is like shell but for windows
4. and its still used today, because according to the lecture it allows you to interact with your system faster, and change system seettings, troubleshoot, or accomplish a alot of task that sometimes modern os's cant even do. For example in older versions of linux it would require you to utilize shell to add a printer
## What are the commands to change directories, list the file’s contents and rename/move files?
1. change directories- cd/
                       pwd
2. list file contents- ls ~ > file_list.txt
                        wc -l file_list.txt
                        rm file_list.txt
3. rename/move files- mv backup_combined.txt combined_backup.txt
                      ls
   
## What are relative and absolute paths? What is special about starting with a ~ (tilde) or a ‘/’ character in the path?
According to bing AI , " An absolute path is a path that starts from the root directory" and it would start with a forward / whereas "A relative path is a path that starts from the current working directory of the user. " and do not start with a forward /.
