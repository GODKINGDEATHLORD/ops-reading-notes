## Things I want to know more about

It is funny cause my friends computer is having problems, and he asked if I could look at it last night. His pc updated to a newer version of windows, and it affected his aspect ratio, and there was a black box surrounding scrreen on his monitior. When he tried to perform the next update because there was more, it would not allow him cause there wasnt enough space on his hardrive. I went into his system info and pulled his specs to look at his motherboard, and I was going to upgrade his hardware, by adding a newer nvme drive thats compatible, and just throwing in some ram sticks cause his computer is slow. We just did this though instead , and it fixed his issue. I read this earlier yesterday, and nothing was clicking, I just needed a nap
