You can create a plain-text file, scripting commands, and have Bash runn all of them for you rather than you having to run them all one by one

I would actually run multiple Bash-like commands everyday for work (im not exactly certain it was bash). We had to be super careful , because if we made a mistake, or didnt prep the computer to run the command we would get these crazy errors, and have to do everything manually which could take the whole day
