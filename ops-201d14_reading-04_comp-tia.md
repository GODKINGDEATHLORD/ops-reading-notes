## What should you do if multiple issues are happening simultaneously during troubleshooting?
*Document all of it, so you can get a better understanding of what it could be, and begin to establish better theories* 
## What should be done once a successful solution has been identified during the troubleshooting process?
*Once you find a succesful solution, you need to then develop a plan of action. This may require, a plan A,B,and C, just in case your initial fix runs into issues in the future.*
## What are the benefits of documenting the entire troubleshooting process in a knowledge base?
*It can benefit yourself, if you are to revisit the problem, or if you just wanted to see what your thought procces was at the time. It can also benefit the cusstomer by allowing them to search up the problem and find the solution on their own*
## Think about a technological device particularly popular in your culture or community. Imagine a scenario where issues arise: how would you apply CompTIA A+ troubleshooting methodology to help, while considering the end-userâ€™s cultural background?
*In Lean Six Sigma, we have a similar methodology when approaching problems. One of the main methods we use is DMAIC, which is Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control. In DMAIC , We would define, or indentify the problem. Then we measure, see how bad it really is. Once we have our data we analyze, or utilize the data to try to formulate a possible solution to the problem ,or try to establish/test our theory/ establish plan of action. Then after that we improve, or implement the plan. After that we do the control, or try to figure out a way to keep it going,and ensure our new process actually works so we dont run into problems in the future, so verify full system  functionality, and document findings.*
