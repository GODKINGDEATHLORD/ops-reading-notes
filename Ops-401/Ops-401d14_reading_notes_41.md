# [What is Penetration Testing](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/penetration-testing/)

## How are the stages of a pen test very similar to those of the Cyber Kill Chain?

Based on the text provided, here's how the stages of a pen test can be seen as similar to those of the Cyber Kill Chain:

- **Reconnaissance**: In both the Cyber Kill Chain and pen testing, the first step involves gathering intelligence. The text states, "Gathering intelligence (e.g., network and domain names, mail server) to better understand how a target works and its potential vulnerabilities."
- **Weaponization & Delivery**: These stages are akin to the "Scanning" step in pen testing, where tools are used to inspect how the application behaves, resembling the weaponization and delivery of an exploit.
- **Exploitation**: Corresponds to "Gaining Access" in pen testing, which involves exploiting vulnerabilities, "typically by escalating privileges, stealing data, intercepting traffic, etc., to understand the damage they can cause."
- **Installation & Command and Control**: These are similar to "Maintaining access" in pen testing, which aims to determine if the vulnerability can be exploited over time, mimicking advanced persistent threats.
- **Actions on Objectives**: The final stage of the Cyber Kill Chain aligns with the "Analysis" phase of pen testing, where the outcomes are used to understand the impact and to enhance security measures.


## Your manager has asked you to explain the benefits of a pen test to the company's leadership. How would you lead this conversation?

"Pentests are an essential component of our security measures. They allow us to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities within our systems before they can be exploited by actual attackers. As stated in the text from Imperva, the insights provided by the penetration test can be used to 'fine-tune your WAF security policies and patch detected vulnerabilities.' Furthermore, pen testing offers comprehensive insights into the efficacy of our security posture and can 'help configure an enterpriseâ€™s WAF settings and other application security solutions to patch vulnerabilities and protect against future attacks.' Additionally, conducting regular pen tests can help us to satisfy compliance requirements for security auditing procedures, such as PCI DSS and SOC 2, which are critical for maintaining our reputation and customer trust. Overall, penetration testing is a vital tool for fortifying our cyber defenses and ensuring the integrity and resilience of our digital infrastructure."
